    ```
    note: Because the data is imbalanced, the F1-Score is used as a reference
    ```

- Confusion Matrix:

    ```
    Correct:
        Male: 195 | Female: 295
    ```

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the PyTorch VGG-16 architecture in gender classification, even in the presence of an imbalanced dataset. Further improvements and fine-tuning can be explored for enhanced performance.
