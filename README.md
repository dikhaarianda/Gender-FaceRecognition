- Classification Report:

    ![Report](https://github.com/dikhaarianda/FaceRecognition-VGG16/blob/master/assets/ClassificationReport.png)
    ```
    note: Because the data is imbalanced, the F1-Score is used as a reference
    ```

- Confusion Matrix:

    ![confusion](https://github.com/dikhaarianda/FaceRecognition-VGG16/blob/master/assets/ConfusionMatrix.png)
    ```
    Correct:
        Male: 195 | Female: 295
    ```

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the PyTorch VGG-16 architecture in gender classification, even in the presence of an imbalanced dataset. Further improvements and fine-tuning can be explored for enhanced performance.
